      "Participated in Hackathon Udvikash organized by Uncalled Innovators. Our team collaborated to build an innovative solution focused on food delivery for needy people as well as for friends and family. The project emphasized problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity in addressing real-world challenges. We developed the platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and incorporated Bootstrap for responsive styling along with engaging animations to enhance user experience. This experience helped me strengthen my front-end development skills, teamwork, and time management while working in a competitive hackathon environment.",

      "Took part in Hack Forge 1.0, a 24-hour online hackathon organized by Cloud Forge. Our team developed and presented a project idea under tight deadlines and showcased it virtually. We built CityFix, a web-based solution designed to address and report issues within a particular street or area, enabling communities to raise concerns and get them resolved efficiently. We leveraged MERN Stack to handle backend and deployment, while focusing on building a scalable and user-friendly interface. The hackathon strengthened our ability to ideate quickly, manage tasks under pressure, collaborate effectively in a virtual setup, and pitch solutions clearly to judges.",
